# Investigating-TMDb-Movies-Database

I analyzed a TMDb movies database from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies, short films and TV series collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings, revenue, runtime and budget.

In this project, i’ll be answering the following questions:

    What month is considered “best” for releasing a films/shows?
    What's the bigest 10 productions companies by revnue?
    What genres are associated with films/shows that have high revenues?
    What percentage do the top 5 genres make up?
 
Conclusions:

Throughout this data analysis, I posed questions that Production Companies might find useful, and I’ve come to several conclusions:

The conclusions I’ve come to in analyzing the relationship between ratings and run time are that short films (less than 10 minutes) are likely to have a mid-to-high rating, and TV series (greater than 300 minutes) consistently get higher-than average ratings. The ratings of films/shows with a run time of around 100 minutes are unpredictable, as they can run from low to high, and films with a run time above or below 100 minutes tend to have mid-to-high ratings. Just at first glance of the scatterplot, users are more friendly – as in they tend to give mostly mid-to-high ratings overall – so production companies will want to make sure their film/show is reviewed on TMDB.

If you’re a production company and you want to know what genres earn the highest revenues, my bar chart above concluded that out of the top earning films/shows,
Adventure, Action and Science Fiction were the most frequent genres on that list. You can conclude that you are more likely to earn a higher revenue if you produce those genres.

Universal Pictures are the biggest movie production company in the world by a mile; alomst doubling the revenue of it's nearest compatitor Warner Bros.

Finally, when I calculated the percentages of each genre, I noticed that only of the highest earning genres is in the top 5 most frequently produced genres (Action). Perhaps it is because Adventure and Science Fiction movies are more expensive to produce so they are more rarely made, or perhaps production companies want to focus on genres that are more popular with people, not necessarily the genres that produce the highest revenues. No matter the cause, I can conclude that just because a genre produces a larger revenue than others, doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to be one of the most frequently produced genres.
